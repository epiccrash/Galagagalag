created by Lukas Peraza
 for 15-112 F15 Pygame Optional Lecture, 11/11/15

use this code in your term project if you want
- CITE IT
- you can modify it to your liking
  - BUT STILL CITE IT

- you should remove the print calls from any function you aren't using
- you might want to move the pygame.display.flip() to your redrawAll function,
    in case you don't need to update the entire display every frame (then you
    should use pygame.display.update(Rect) instead)
