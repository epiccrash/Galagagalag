Running the game:
Within a Python 3 IDE, open and run the file Game.py. Alternatively, from the command line, write:
python3 -i Game.py
within the Galagagalag folder.

Library imports:
This project should function independently of any external libraries. Those that were imported into the project are either contained within the project directory (like the font, Press Start 2P), or imported using Austin Schick's module manager (which is also within the game's directory).
The one sticking point is the Xbox controller: the game can function without it, however to use the controller, you may need to install Xbox 360 drivers, or on a Mac, download FranticRain's Xbox 360 Controller Driver 0.16.5 or later (https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases). Additionally, this was implemented with a third-party controller, so functionality is not guaranteed.
